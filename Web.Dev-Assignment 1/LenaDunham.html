 <h1> Dunham apologises for supporting rape accused </h1>

 
 <h3>The Girls creator stood up for one of the show's writers who was accused of rape
 but Twitter users were unimpressed. </h3>

 <p> Lena Dunham has apologised for supporting a writer on her TV show Girls after he was 
 accused of sexually assaulting an actress. Murray Miller is accused of raping Aurora Perrineau in 2012, when she was 17 - a claim he
 has denied through his lawyer. The allegations were made public on Friday and Dunham tweeted in his support, on behalf
 of herself and Girls executive producer Jenni Konner. </p>

 <p> She had written: "...During every time of change there are also incidences of the culture,
 in its enthusiasm and zeal, taking down the wrong targets."We believe, having worked closely with [Miller] for more than half a decade, that this is
 the case with Murray Miller. </p>

 <p> "While our first instinct is to listen to every woman's story, our insider knowledge of Murray's 
 situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that
 are misreported every year." </p> </a>

 <p> Dunham was widely criticised by Twitter users, many of whom retweeted a message she
 posted in August, which said: "Things women do lie about: what they ate for lunch. Things
 women don't lie about: rape." </p>

 <p> I believe in a lot of things but the first tenet of my politics is to hold up the people
 who have held me up, who have filled my world with love. </p>

 <p> Your are exactly what victims fear when they come forward. A trusted voice denying the possibility
 of the claim, providing character reference to a wolf in sheep's clothing. Predators rely on people like you. </p>

 <p> On Saturday, the Hollywood Reporter said she had tweeted an apology: "As feminists, we live and die by
 our politics, and believing women is the first choice we make every single day when we wake up. </p>

 <p> "Therefore I never thought I would issue a statement publically (sic) supporting someone accused of sexual assault,
 but I naively believed it was important to share my perspective on my friend's situation as it has transpired behind the
 scenes over the last few months. </p>

 <p>"I now understand that it was absolutely the wrong time to come forward with such a statement and I am
 so sorry. We have been given the gift of powerful voices and by speaking out we were putting our thumb on
 the scale and it was wrong. We regret this decision with every fiber of our being." </p> </a>

 <p> TheWrap, which broke the original story, said that Perrineau had filed a report with the Los Angeles County
 Sheriff's Department. </p>

 <p> In a statement reprinted by the Hollywood Reporter, Mr Miller's lawyer Don Walerstein said: "Mr. Miller
 categorically and vehemently denies Ms Perrineau's outrageous claims. </p>

 <p> "After being contacted several weeks ago by lawyers who - on Ms Perrineau's behalf - sought substantial monetary
 damages from him, Mr. Miller's legal team gathered overwhelming evidence directly contradicting these false and offensive claims. </p>

 <p> "Only after her demands for money were rebuffed did Ms Perrineau go to the police. Mr Miller looks forward to sharing all
 evidence and information with any and all authorities seeking the truth in this matter." </p>

 <p> Mr Miller is also known as having been a producer on the Fox animated comedies King Of The Hill and American Dad. </p>
