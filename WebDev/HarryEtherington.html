      <p> This is a Problem & Workaround Set for a series of CSS Boxes going from a </p>
      <p> simple single box, through 3 columns with a full width top box, all with </p>
      <p> variations. </p>
     
     
        <p> There are also some relevant content placement issues that affect box </p>
        <p> positioning, a little gem of a bg image problem or two, and my own </p>
        <p> explanation of what it's all about. </p>
    
        <p> What this isn't, is a how-to for CSS layout. This is a how-to for dealing with the </p>
        <p> misinterpretations of our current browsers. If you're new to CSS, this is a </p>
        <p> better place to start. </p>
  
  
  
  <p> Enjoy. </p>

  <h2> CAVEAT - a Warning and an Explanation </h2>
  
  <p> Box Lessons was written way back in 2001. In CSS terms that's nearly </p>
  <p>  archaic. </p>
    
    
  <p> At that time, CSS was not used for positioning. Browser support was  </p>
  <p> either poor or mpossibly flawed, as with the then-popular Netscape 4. </p>
    
  <p> This was bad because instead of using CSS, web designers misused </p>
  <p> table tags to achieve layout. Which failed in anything but the latest </p>
  <p> browsers for home computer screens -- it was no good for audio </p>
  <p> readers, cell phones, or really anything other than IE and Netscape. </p>
  <p> Which was completely at odds with the whole "write once, read </p> 
  <p> anywhere" point of the web. </p>
