  <p> To get a feel for our league, we recommend you call us at the number below or stop by </p> 
  <p> Davies Sporting Goods to talk to one or our coordinators and get the details on our next all- </p>

  <p> players in the league. </P>
  
  <p> If you're interested in joining up, you'll need to complete some paperwork and pay $65 for a </p>
