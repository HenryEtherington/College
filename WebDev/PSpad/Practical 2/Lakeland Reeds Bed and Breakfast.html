<h2> About Us </h2>

<p>Lakeland Reeds is an ideal place to unplug from your daily routine, whether on the shore of Twin Lakes watching the sundown over the cattails or just curled up in a hammock on our screened wraparound porch with a good book. Breakfast is ready whenever you are, and we're happy to accommodate a wide range of appetites, from comfort food like sausage and biscuits to the lighter end of things, such as egg white omelettes and fresh fruit. </p>

<h3> Our most sought-after weekends: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Independence Day </li>
<li> Memorial Day     </li>
<li> Labor Day        </li>
                      </ul>

<p>We're here to help you get the most out of your time with us, from canoes and life vests for a day out on the lake, to DVDs and popcorn for a quiet evening in. We look forward to welcoming you! </p>
