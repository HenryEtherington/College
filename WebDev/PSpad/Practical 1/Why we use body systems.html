   <p> Why Buy from Body Systems?
Six key reasons why Body Systems equipment is built to last:
Body Systems uses only the highest quality materials and components available. 
All equipment is built with durable, electrostatically applied epoxy powder coat finish to resist scratching, chipping and peeling. 
Our pulley machines are built with impact resistant fiberglass reinforced nylon pulleys with sealed bearings. 
Weight machines support a heavy-duty high tensile strength steel mainframe construction. 
Support beams use four-side welded construction to keep torsional flex to a minimum for solid and stable workouts. 
All weight macines use tear resistant pads and rollers feature high-density, top grade foam for safety, comfort and stability. <p>
