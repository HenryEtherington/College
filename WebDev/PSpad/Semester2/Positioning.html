    <p> It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear
    the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged
    itself to a close. </p>
   
    <p> Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests,
    and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven
    little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. </p>
   
    <p> Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them
    in an orderly and willing line towards the dining-room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread
    and milk and prune pudding. </p>
